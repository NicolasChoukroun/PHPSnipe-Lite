${licensePrefix} Please remember to be pragmatic. this script is not designed to be a scholar example of good programming,
 ${licensePrefix} is designed to be a weapon to protect you against your enemy. Efficiency is more important than style.
 ${licensePrefix} Also, functions names are made to be quick to remember. For example the shortest the best, the function to clean the cache is "cache()"
 ${licensePrefix} this is on purpose. These functions are working as an extension of PHP and are build the same way, as an extension of the language.
${licensePrefix} Commenting is done following the C++/Java styles and designed to be compiled with DOxygen. ProDoc comments will not work.
