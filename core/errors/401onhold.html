			<h1>Account On Hold</h1>
			<p>Your account is stopped for a limited time. There are several possible reasons:
            <br>1- You did something wrong but not bad enough to be banned.
            <br>2- You irritated TheWolf and got this in return.
            <br><br>There is no way to fix that. No need to try to contact TheWolf, it won't change anything. You just have to wait. Typically 1 week.
